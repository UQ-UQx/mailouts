UQx Mailouts
========

UQx Mailouts sends email newsletters using Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). UQx Mailouts imports and updates a subscription list from the email_opt_in-prod-analytics.csv file that is downloaded with the edX data dump. UQx Mailouts stores email newsletters and ensures that no duplicate emails are sent to a learner that is enrolled in multiple courses.

```

**Install Python and Django Requirements**


A requirements.txt file is provided in the code repository.

```

**Install UQx Mailouts**

Edit mailouts/settings.py
Enter secret key
Create a database (both MySQL and Postgres are supported). Enter database port and name in settings.py

If a new database was created, you will need to setup the database tables and create a superuser.
```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Now you can run the django webserver:
```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

**Sending an Email Newsletter**
If a new database was created go to http://localhost:8000/admin and login with superuser account. The Django admin interface is used to add Newsletters.

- Add a newsletter. You will need an Amazon SES verified from email address. Both HTML and Plaintext emails are supported. A comma separated list of courses (i.e., the edX course id) must be specified. A student will only be included as an email recipient once even if they are enrolled in multiple courses.
